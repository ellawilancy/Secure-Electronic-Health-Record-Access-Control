# Electronic Health Record Access Control System

This system provides a blockchain-based framework for secure, transparent, and patient-controlled electronic health record (EHR) access management. It employs four key smart contracts to handle identity verification, provider authentication, consent management, and comprehensive access auditing.

## Core Components

### Patient Identity Contract
- Creates and manages secure healthcare identifiers
- Implements robust identity verification protocols
- Links patient identities to blockchain addresses

### Provider Verification Contract
- Validates credentials of healthcare entities
- Maintains registry of authorized providers
- Enables secure provider-to-patient connections

### Consent Management Contract
- Tracks detailed patient approvals for data sharing
- Implements fine-grained permission controls
- Ensures compliance with healthcare privacy regulations

### Access Audit Contract
- Records comprehensive logs of all record access events
- Provides immutable audit trails for compliance
- Enables patient visibility into who accessed their records

## System Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Cryptographic protection of sensitive health data
- **Patient Empowerment**: Individuals control who accesses their medical information
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built to accommodate HIPAA and other privacy frameworks
- **Transparency**: Complete visibility into the access history of medical records
- **Interoperability**: Designed to work across different healthcare systems
